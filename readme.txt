Documentation -------------

Used Libraries:

-----------Project 4------------

In this project, we successfully impleneted two features with ajax, one is autocomplete search of movie title (full-text search),
the other one is to show movie details when user put mouse on the movie title in movielist page.

In the second part, we made an android app, as well as the extra credit features.
We wrote servlets for android app, so android can send request to server, and get a json object back.
Andoid client will parse the json object, and display the useful information.

Both of these two tasks were used full-text search technique.

Everything should work as the instructions in the CS122B Spring 2016 homepage. Except, we have combined add To Cart and CheckOut together.
Specifically, our system asks users to login in using customer's email and password to link to the main page.
After logging, users can browse, search movies and get details of movies or stars by clicking the button.
The system supports partial searching so that it is even easier to browse or search movies.
The system also supports browse by genre, browse by title.
The system supports cart functionality where users can add liked movies into their carts and users can also modify elements in the cart such as quantities.
Users are allowed to checkout the movies in cart after providing correct credit card information.
